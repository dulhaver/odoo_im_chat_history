# this module is working under OpenERP saas1 "Instant Messaging" Module (technical name [im])

# it adds a Menu 'IM' which lists all internal chat messages between users. 
# These chat messages can be be filtered with the standard OpenERP Search Tool. 
# NOTE: this is for INTERNAL chat messages

# this Version here (which was made for OpenERP saas1) should be ported to provide same functionality with 
# the odoo 8.0 "Instant Messaging" [im_chat]
# https://github.com/OCA/OCB/tree/8.0/addons/im_chat

# please note: this is NOT about the livechat (im_livechat) of odoo 8.0, which is a chat tool for 
# external chats (customer support from a website for example) and which provides it's own 'history' functionality
